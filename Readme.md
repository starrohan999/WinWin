# Problem statement
When we talk about lottery app there is lots of myth most people don't trust the app because of the centralized database and no transparency. They all thought a winner is always a person from the lottery organization.
There are several drawbacks to a web2-based lottery application:
1. Centralization: Web2-based lottery applications are centralized, meaning that they are controlled by a single entity or organization.
2. Lack of transparency: The lack of transparency in web2-based lottery applications can create distrust among users. 
3. Limited accessibility: Web2-based lottery applications are limited to a specific platform, such as a website or mobile application. This can limit the number of participants who can access the lottery, reducing its reach.
4. High fees: Web2-based lottery applications charge high transaction fees, which can discourage users from participating in the lottery.
5. Limited customization: Web2-based lottery applications have limited customization options, which can make it difficult to create a unique and engaging user experience.


# Solution
ALL things can be sorted using WEB 3.0 powers The main USP is Hashing with Keccak256.
keccak256 computes the Keccak-256 hash of the input.
Some use cases are:
Creating a deterministic unique ID from an input
Commit-Reveal scheme
Compact cryptographic signature (by signing the hash instead of a larger input).

Decentralization, Trust and transparency, Accessibility, Low fees: Web3-based lottery Dapps charge low transaction fees, as they do not require intermediaries or third-party services.

Overall, the benefits of web3-based lottery Dapps make them a promising option for creating fair, transparent, and accessible lottery systems. They offer a high level of security, trust, and transparency to users, while also providing a customizable and low-cost solution for developers.
